# Simple HTTP Proxy

This example contains a base HTTP proxy server that listens on port :8080.
It only handles explicit CONNECT requests.

Start it in one shell:

```sh
go build
base -v
```

Fetch a website using the proxy:
```sh
http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8080 wget -O - \
	http://ripper234.com/p/introducing-goproxy-light-http-proxy/
```

The homepage HTML content should be displayed in the console.
The proxy should have logged the request being processed:

```sh
