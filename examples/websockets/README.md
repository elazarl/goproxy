# Websockets
`websockets` example shows an example of a WebSocket request made
through the proxy server.
The target server continuously send data to the client, and the proxy will
forward them to websocket client.
To run this example, it's enough to just run the main.

Inside this folder there are also some self-signed certificates valid for
localhost, that are automatically used for the WebSocket server.
